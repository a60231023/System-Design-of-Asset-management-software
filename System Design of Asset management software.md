# Introduction

<br>

So, what does an Asset management software do ?

> An Asset Management System is a software solution that track and manage an organization's assets, including equipment, machinery, vehicles, buildings, and other physical assets. The system provides a centralized(generally) database that stores all asset information, including location, maintenance history, warranty information, and other relevant details.

This helps the  organizations to track the entire lifecycle of an asset, from acquisition to disposal. The system provides real-time visibility into asset utilization, performance, and maintenance history, enabling organizations to make data-driven decisions about asset management and optimization.

They  offer a range of benefits, including increased efficiency and productivity, reduced maintenance costs, and improved asset utilization. 

# System Requirements
<br>

The key requirements that need to be offered by the asset management system can be classified into **functional** and **non-functional** requirements.

Let's first see its *Functional Requriements*

<br>

# Functional Requriements

<br>

Functional Requirements of an Asset Management System typically include the following:

<br>

> **Asset Tracking:** The system should be able to track the location and status of assets in real-time, including asset acquisition, movement, and disposal.
> 
> **Maintenance Management:** To schedule and track preventive maintenance and repairs, including work orders, service requests, and maintenance history.
> 
> **Inventory Management:** It should be aable to manage inventory levels, reorder points, and supplier information for asset-related spare parts and materials.
>
> **Depreciation Tracking:** To track the depreciation of assets over time, including the calculation of asset values and the reporting of depreciation expenses.
> 
> **Reporting and Analytics:** The ability to generate reports and analytics related to asset utilization, maintenance costs, inventory levels, and other key performance indicators.
>
> **Integration with other Enterprise Systems:** The ability to integrate with other enterprise systems, to ensure data consistency and streamline asset management processes.
>
> **Mobile Access:** The ability to access asset information and management functions through mobile devices, such as smartphones and tablets.
>
> **User Roles and Permissions:** The system should be able to assign different user roles and permissions to ensure proper access control and security.
>
> **Asset Catalog:** The ability to create an asset catalog with detailed information about each asset, including serial numbers, model numbers, and other specifications.

Overall, Functional Requirements of an Asset Management System are designed to provide a comprehensive solution for tracking, managing, and optimizing an organization's assets. The system should be able to handle all aspects of asset management, from acquisition to disposal, and provide a user-friendly interface for accessing asset information and management functions.

<br>

A basic list of key features that need to be supported by the system is given in the **use case** diagram.
<br>

<br>
The diagram shows the actors involved in the system and the various use cases that they can perform. The actors in the system include the Admin which is the Asset Manager and the employee.

The Asset Manager is responsible for managing the assets, including tracking their location, status, and maintenance history. They can perform use cases such as Adding Assets, Updating Asset Information, and Generating Asset Reports.

While the employees can read about the asset, records of the asset along with their history. They can also view their profile and verify the assets.
    
<br>

Moving on to the  *Non-functional Requriements*

<br>

# Non-functional Requriements

<br>    

Non-Functional Requirements of an Asset Management System typically include the following:

<br>

> **Security:** The system should have robust security features to ensure that asset information is protected from unauthorized access, modification, or deletion. This includes features such as role-based access control, data encryption, and user authentication.
>
> **Scalability:** The system should be able to scale to meet the changing needs of the organization, including the ability to handle increasing amounts of asset data and user traffic.
>
> **Availability:** The system should be highly available and reliable, with minimal downtime or disruptions. This includes features such as backup and disaster recovery mechanisms, fault tolerance, and system monitoring.
>
> **Performance:** The system should be able to perform quickly and efficiently, with minimal lag time or delays. This includes features such as optimized database queries, caching mechanisms, and load balancing.
>
> **Usability:** The system should be user-friendly and easy to navigate, with clear and intuitive interfaces for accessing asset information and management functions.
>
> **Compatibility:** The system should be compatible with other enterprise systems and technologies, to ensure seamless data exchange and integration.
>
> **Maintainability:** The system should be easy to maintain and upgrade, with clear documentation, support services, and a well-designed architecture.
>
> **Compliance:** The system should comply with relevant regulatory and industry standards, such as data privacy laws, environmental regulations, and health and safety guidelines.
>
> **Localization:** The system should be designed to support multiple languages and localization requirements, such as currency and date formats, to accommodate global operations.

Overall, Non-Functional Requirements of an Asset Management System are designed to ensure that the system meets the organization's needs for security, scalability, availability, performance, usability, compatibility, maintainability, compliance, and localization. These requirements are critical to ensuring that the system can support the organization's asset management needs effectively and efficiently.

# Software Requirements

<br>

- A server running Windows Server/Linux OS
- A multi-threading capable backend language like Java
- Front-end frameworks like Angular/React/Vue for the client
- Relational DBMS like MySQL, PostgreSQL, etc
- Containers and orchestration services like Kubernetes (for a large setting like a national library).
